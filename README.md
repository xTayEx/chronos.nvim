# chronos.nvim

A simple plugin to show a clock in a floating window. I create this plugin just for fun ðŸ˜Š.

## Usage

- `:ChronosOpen`: Open the clock.
- `:ChronosClose`: Close the clock.

## Dependencies
No extra dependencies (as for now). Only tested on neovim v0.11.0. Older version may work.

## Roadmap
- [ ] More clock styles.
- [ ] Support alarm with audio.
- [ ] Support different clock location.
